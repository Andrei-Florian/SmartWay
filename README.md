# Overview
Parents always worry about their children. Parents want their children to arrive to school punctual and get home on time, taking the assigned path.

SmartWay aims to remove this worry from the parent's everyday life. SmartWay will monitor your child as he/she gets to and from school, ensuring that your child always takes the appropriate path to arrive at his/her destination, school.

SWay will Monitor your child's geolocation using GPS and will immediately send the parent an e-mail if the child deviates form the path you assigned to him/her. SmartWay will also send the parent an e-mail when the child arrives home or to school, as well as informing them if the child is late. This way, parents can sit back and enjoy their coffee knowing that their child arrives safely to school and home.
